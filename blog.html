            <p class="text-lg font-medium">A variable declaration is simply telling the computer that a variable
                exists and what value it should
                start
                with. Similar to other programming languages JavaScript also allows for the declaration of variables.

                There are three keywords in JavaScript that can be used to declare variables: let, var, and const. Each
                keyword has different rules and implications for how the variables they create can be used.

                let: The let keyword declares a block-scoped local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
                Block-scoped means that the variable is only available within the block it was declared in, which is
                usually
                denoted by curly braces {}.

                var: The var keyword declares a function-scoped or global variable, optionally initializing it to a
                value.
                Function-scoped means that the variable is only available within the function it was declared in. Global
                variables are available throughout your entire code.

                const: The const keyword declares a block-scoped, immutable constant variable, i.e. a variable that
                can’t be
                reassigned.
                Constants are also called “immutable variables”, but that’s a bit of a misnomer since they are actually
                variables – just ones that can’t be reassigned.</p>

            <p class="text-lg font-medium">Arrow function — also called fat arrow function— is a new feature introduced
                in ES6 that is a more concise syntax for writing function expressions. While both regular JavaScript
                functions and arrow functions work in a similar manner, there are certain differences between them.

                The arrow function example above allows a developer to accomplish the same result with fewer lines of
                code and approximately half the typing.
                // (param1, param2, paramN) => expression
                // ES5
                var add = function(x, y) {
                return x + y;
                };
                // ES6
                let add = (x, y) => { return x + y };

                Curly brackets aren’t required if only one expression is present. The above example can also be written
                like this:let add = (x, y) => x + y;

            <p class="text-lg font-medium"><span>
                    1. Foreach
                    The easy one right ? we all know why this method is used for and even you don’t know about this
                    method the name pretty much explains everything.

                    Foreach takes a callback function and run that callback function on each element of array one by
                    one.
                </span>
                <span>
                    2. Filter
                    Whenever you have to filter an array Javascript inbuilt method to filter your array is the right
                    choice to use. Filter let you provide a callback for every element and returns a filtered array.

                    The main difference between forEach and filter is that forEach just loop over the array and executes
                    the callback but filter executes the callback and check its return value. If the value is true
                    element remains in the resulting array but if the return value is false the element will be removed
                    for the resulting array.

                <span>
                    3. Map
                    One of my favourite and most used array method of all time. As a ReactJS developer I use map a lot
                    inside my application UI.

                    Map like filter & foreach takes a callback and run it against every element on the array but whats
                    makes it unique is it generate a new array based on your existing array.

            <p class="text-lg font-medium">You can use template strings to write your string exactly how you want it to
                appear, without all the quotation marks and confusion. Template strings make it very easy to spot a
                missing space and make your string more readable.
